## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate developer focused on building smart and interactive tools for communities.  
From Discord bots to AI-powered applications and data automation pipelines, I love turning ideas into code!

- 🔭 Currently working on **F1F Bot** – an advanced Formula 1 prediction & moderation bot  
- 🧪 Exploring **MLflow**, **OpenAI API**, and **prompt evaluation frameworks**  
- 📦 Automating data scraping, cleaning, and formatting (`.pkl`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`)  
- 📚 Enhancing documentation and reproducibility with **Sphinx** and **Jupyter**

## 🎓 What I Learned at ESIEA

During my studies at **ESIEA**, I had the opportunity to explore a wide range of programming languages, tools, and development concepts.

### 🔧 Languages & Tools

- **C & C++** – Core programming concepts, memory management, data structures  
- **C#** – Object-Oriented Programming and Unity game development  
- **Python** – My main language for backend, AI, automation, and data workflows  
- **Unity 2D/3D** – Game mechanics, animation, physics, and input handling with C#  
- **Linux / Bash** – Command line, scripting, and system tools  
- **Git / GitHub** – Version control, collaboration, GitOps practices  
- **Makefiles / CMake** – Building and maintaining C/C++ projects  

### 🧠 Concepts Explored

- Embedded systems  
- Computer graphics (OpenGL basics)  
- Game physics and scripting with Unity  
- Client/server communication  
- Software architecture and documentation  
- Algorithm design and complexity analysis  
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
